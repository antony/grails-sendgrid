Introduction
----------

The Grails SendGrid plugin allows you to use the services offered by [SendGrid|http://sendgrid.com] to send email from your application.

Installation
----------

Add the following dependencies in `build.gradle`
```
dependencies {
...
    compile 'desirableobjects.grails.plugins:grails-sendgrid:2.0'
...
}
```

Configuration
----------

Configuration takes place in your application's yaml file.

The basic configuration you will need to use the plugin is:

```yaml
    sendgrid:
        username: 'your-username'
        password: 'your-password'
```

Where your-username and your-password should be replaced with your sendgrid login details.

If you need to override the sengrid API endpoint (such as for development/integration environments, to replace it with a fake 'fixture'), you can do that in the same place:


```yaml
    sendgrid:
        api:
            url: 'http://localhost:8080/your-application/fixture/'
        username: 'your-username'
        password: 'your-password'
```

Note that your @fixture@ controller must have the 'mail.send.json' action configured, and sending and receiving @application/json@ content, as this is what the plugin expects to call.

Sending Email
----------

In a pinch, you can send email using the SendGridService in one of three ways:

* Using any controller's built-in sendMail method, and passing your email details to it.

 > Note: This is the grails-mail way of doing things, and should always be your preferred method to allow for quick and easy interchange of any grails-supported mail plugin.

```groovy
sendMail {
     from 'antony@example.com'
     to 'aiten@example.net'
     to 'wirah@example.org'
     bcc 'yourbcc@example.com'
     subject 'This is the subject line'
     body 'This is our message body'
}
```

* Using the sendMail closure from any class which has a reference to the SendGridService.

As above, but referencing the sendMail method of the SendGridService directly:

```groovy
sendGridService.sendMail {
    ...
}
```

3* Using the email builder

This is useful when you might want a more programmatic approach to sending email.

```groovy
SendGridEmail email = new SendGridEmailBuilder()
                        .from('antony@example.com')
                        .to('aiten@example.net')
                        .subject('This is the subject line')
                        .withText('This is our message body')
                        .build()
```

When you've built your email, pass it to the SendGridService's send method:

```groovy
sendGridService.send(email)
```

The email builder is written as a natural-language type DSL, so you might find that there is more than one way to build your email, but under the covers, they are exactly the same.
